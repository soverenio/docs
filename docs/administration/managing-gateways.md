# Managing gateways

Soveren allows you to manage multiple gateways. 
You may want to create more than one gateway if you need to monitor groups of services separately and for analysis sustainability.

You can see and manage all your gateways on the [gateways page](https://app.soveren.io/gateways).

1. Visit the [gateways page](https://app.soveren.io/gateways).

## Set up a gateway

To set up a gateway immediately after creating it, follow the instructions on the slide-in popup. Don't close the page or click outside the popup not to lose it.
