# Managing Agents

You need one Agent per each of your Kubernetes clusters that you want Soveren to monitor.

If you have multiple clusters and hence multiple Agents, Soveren will show them separately on the [data map](https://app.soveren.io/data-map). The clusters will be defined by the names of the Agents that you deploy in them.

Soveren app identifies each Agent by the token.
