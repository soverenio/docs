# Managing Agents

You need one Agent per each of your Kubernetes clusters that you want Soveren to monitor. If you have multiple clusters and thus multiple Agents, the [Soveren app](https://app.soveren.io/) will aggregate data from all of them in a single pane of control.

Each Agent is identified by the token. You can browse and manage Agents and their tokens on the [agents page](https://app.soveren.io/agents).
