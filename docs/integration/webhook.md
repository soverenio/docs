# Webhook

## Why use webhooks

Soveren provides you with the [nice UI](../overview/#events) to respond to all sorts of events happening in your infrastructure. However sometimes it is more convenient to use the knowledge about the events in other automation tools like process management or risk management systems. A common example of such system is [Security information and event management (SIEM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_information_and_event_management).

A webhook between Soveren and your application tells your application whenever something important happens, so that you don't even need to open the UI and your regular workflow is directly enriched and is up to date.

## Configuring the webhook

Creating a webhook is simple and straightforward.

First, open the [Integrations in the Soveren app](https://app.soveren.io/integrations/), and press Connect on the Webhook configuration there:

The following [configuration panel](https://app.soveren.io/integrations/webhook/) will open:
