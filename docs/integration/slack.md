# Integration with Slack

## Why use Slack integration

The Slack integration comes in handy when you need to notify certain people right away if something pops up in [Soveren app](../overview/) which requires immediate attention.

## Configuring the integration with Slack

Configuring the Slack integration is very easy. Open the [Integrations in the Soveren app](https://app.soveren.io/integrations/), and press **Connect** on the Slack configuration there:

You will be carried directly to settings in your Slack workspace, it should look like the following:

![Slack configuration: setting](../../img/integration/slack-config-init.png "Slack configuration: setting")

To proceeed, you need to **Allow** those settings. Then, you need to choose the event types and the channel:

![Slack configuration: event types and channel](../../img/integration/slack-config-next.png "Slack configuration: event types and channel")

Pressing **Save and enable** finalizes the configuration.

The notifications that you will receive will look like this:

The [Event object](../event-objects/) page describes the structure of messages that you will get.
