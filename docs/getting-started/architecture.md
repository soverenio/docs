# Architecture

Soveren consists of two major parts: Soveren Agent which you [install](../quick-start/) in your Kubernetes cluster, and [Soveren Cloud](https://app.soveren.io/) which is hosted by Soveren and provides all the fucntionality actually visible to you in the form of [dashboards](../../user-guide/overview/).
