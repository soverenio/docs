Add a data source
=============================

Data sources are systems your company uses to store and process customer data.

Adding a data source allows you to automate interaction with it while processing data subject requests.

In other words, you won't have process data manually in each data source. Soveren Privacy Suite will do it for you.

------------

Soveren distinguishes between standard and custom data sources:

* A standard data source is normally a SaaS system, such as Mailgun, HubSpot, ZenDesk, etc.

* A custom data source is normally an on-premise company solution for storing data, such as a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL.

      For example, "HubSpot for sales" or "HubSpot for marketing".

      Source name shows up in reports to your data subject. We recommend you describe in short detail what the source does. For example, "platform for marketing, sales, customer service, and CRM software" for HubSpot.

      If this particular source has specific limits, state it. For example, "platform for marketing" for the data source "HubSpot for marketing".
