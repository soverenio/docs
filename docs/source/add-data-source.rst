Add a standard data source
=============================

Data sources are systems your company uses to store and process customer data.

Adding a data source allows you to automate interaction with it while processing data subject requests.

In other words, you won't have process data manually in each data source. Soveren Privacy Suite will do it for you.

.. tip::

   Source name shows up in reports to your data subject. We recommend you use the official data source name and add additional information if you have multiple source of the same type.

   For example, "HubSpot for sales" or "HubSpot for marketing".

   Source name shows up in reports to your data subject. We recommend you describe in short detail what the source does. For example, "platform for marketing, sales, customer service, and CRM software" for HubSpot.
