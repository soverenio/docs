Automating data processing in a standard data source
====================================================

Data sources are systems your company uses to store and process customer data.

Adding a data source allows you to automate interaction with it while processing data subject requests.

In other words, you won't have process data manually in each data source. Soveren Privacy Suite will do it for you.

------------

Once you added a data source, you can automate data processing with it.

1. Automate interaction with the source by connecting to the source one of the following ways:

   * Via OAuth 2.0:

     1. Click **Connect** to be redirected to the source.

     2. Sign in to your account in the source.

     3. Allow Soveren access to the source.

   * Via an API key:

     1. On the page **Automation** tab, click **Read how to find the source API key** and read the instruction.

     2. Follow the instruction from #1 and copy the API key.

     3. Paste the API key to they field **API key** on the **Automation** tab.

2. Enable automation of data processing for the source.

   Use the **Automation** toggle from the **Automate data processing** section.

.. tip::

   The **Automation** toggle only enabled or disables automation in general.

   You still need to enable automation for specific request types below.

3. Enable automation of data processing per subject request type.

   Use the toggles from the **Control automation by type** section.

.. tip::

   The toggles from the **Automate data processing** section only apply when the **Automation** toggle is on.
