Installation
============

`As you learned <../index.html#how-soveren-works>`_, Soveren consists of two parts: Soveren Gateway that lives on prem and Soveren Cloud that lives in the cloud.

You need to install Soveren Gateway within your perimeter.

Currently, Soveren gateway available for installation in your Kubernetes cluster. For other deployment options contact us at support@soveren.io.

Requirements
------------

You need to install `Kubernetes <https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/>`_.

Configure, install, and set up Soveren Gateway
----------------------------------------------

1. `Register a Soveren account <link-to-soveren>`_.

2. Go to your account settings, find and copy the API key (Soveren token).

3. Add the API key to the Kubernetes cluster:

   ::

          kubectl create secret generic soveren-proxy-token --from-literal=token=<soveren-token-from-your-account-on-soveren.io>

4. Install and set up Soveren Gateway using the preconfigured manifest file:

   ::

        kubectl apply -f https://github.com/soverenio/smat/<path-to-the-manifest-file>


5. Ð¡onfigure Soveren Gateway to proxy traffic for your services: edit the ``replicator`` ConfigMap and set the ``url`` parameter in the section ``services`` to point to your service:

   ::

        kubectl edit cm replicator

   ``replicator`` ConfigMap example:

   ::

          # Add the service
          services:
            test-service:
              loadBalancer:
                servers:
                  - url: http://address-of-your-service:port/


   .. admonition:: Tip
      :class: tip

      You can add multiple instances of the same service adding more lines with the ``url`` parameter.

      For routing incoming traffic to multiple services of different types, read the `routing section of Traefik docs <https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/routing/overview/>`_.

6. Configure your service(s) to route traffic to Soveren Gateway.

   .. admonition:: Tip

      Read `Deployment and fallback <fallback.html>`_ for deployment scheme and fallback examples.

7. `Go to the dashboard <link-to-soveren-dashboard>`_ and check the PIIs detected in your traffic and your compound risk score.
