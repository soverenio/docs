Soveren documentation
=====================

Welcome to documentation describing Soveren Privacy Suite.

Overview
--------

Data privacy is a growing issue in today's world and it concerns all companies, small or big.
Soveren Privacy Suite makes it easy for any company to meet modern data privacy standards.

Soveren Privacy Suite is a set of tools that implements services critical for data privacy compliance.

The suite is marketed to on-staff and independent Privacy Officers and allows them to:

* Have a universal tool for multiple projects or companies they work for.
* Integrate this tool with a variety of external sources/custom data storage systems that store private data.
* Build customer-friendly Privacy Centers for data subject request collection.
* Efficiently manage requests received through these centers or created by hand.
* Automate and speed up processing of data subject requests.
* Have processing logs data subject requests to provide on demand during external audits proving the company is GDPR/CCPA compliant.

Under the hood, the suite consists of many parts but the two most important user-facing ones are DPO Portal and Privacy Center.

DPO Portal
^^^^^^^^^^
Soveren's DPO Portal offers a single service for processing data subject requests.

On-staff and independent Privacy Officers equally can apply it to a variety of projects within the company or different companies.

It allows you to register a number of accounts for the projects you handle, and integrate with major SaaSes either via API key or simply logging into them and allowing Soveren access (OAuth 2.0).
We also help you manually integrate your Soveren account with custom solutions run on-premise at your company/companies.

DPO Portal offers a clean UI and user-oriented UX with a single panel to manage data subject requests.

Processing requests is done via a simple wizard. Our suite provides automated agents to search through the integrated data assets for customer data.
You can further review the search results and automatically process the data. Last step of the wizard is to send processing results to the customer in one structured document supplied with an official reply.

All that adds up to efficient data subject request management.


Privacy Center
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Soveren's Privacy Center offers a single interface for customers to reach your project/company and file data subject requests.

You can create a Privacy Center for each your Soveren account providing customers with a connection point. They simply visit *company*.soveren.io where they can exercise their data privacy rights.
A Privacy Center also allows customers to read your company's privacy policy in full.




Data privacy compliance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A great benefit the suite offers to the company is compliance with modern data privacy regulations.
Processing logs for data subject requests are stored for future use.
The company may leverage them in case of government audits as part of the proof it's making every effort to stay GDPR/CCPA compliant.
