=====================

Soveren is a data privacy solution that makes handling personal information easy.

It receives requests and responses from/to your systems, detects personally identifiable information (PII) in them, and stores analysis metadata in Soveren Cloud to give you monitoring and analytics when you need them.

What sets Soveren apart from other data privacy solutions:

* It solves the problem of visibility and data discovery and classification by identifying and classifying personal data in motion with a proxy gateway in the customerâ€™s environment.

* It provides actionable, real-time analytics into personal data-related risks: data sensitivity, where it is coming from, how it is consumed, and which services are involved.

* It highlights risks and helps engineering and security leaders make informed security and privacy decisions.

* It doesn't modify proxied traffic and sends only metadata to Soveren Cloud.

* Proxied traffic isn't delayed by PII detection, and Soveren doesn't increase latency in any significant way.

Our goal is to make Soveren simple and practical so the users can enjoy using it.
