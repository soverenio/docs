Creating a Privacy Center
=========================

Privacy Center is a single point for customer to visit and create data subject requests.

To deploy a Privacy Center instance for your company:

1. Click **Privacy Center** in the left navigation menu on any DPO Portal page.

2. Check your company information to make sure that:

   * Company name is set to the official name of your company.

   * Support email is set to the official support email of your company.

   * Privacy policy link is set to the official privacy policy of your company.

3. Once the company information is set, enter your company name in the the **Your domain name** field.

4. Create your Privacy Center and make it available to the customers by clicking **Publish**.

.. warning::

   You can only set the name from #3 once. Make sure the name is not too long, is readable, and familiar to your customers.

   We recommend you stick to the name used for your company website. For example, github.soveren.io for GitHub rather than anything else.

   However, it may be the case that your company domain name is not the same as the name company uses on its website. In this case, we recommend you choose the option more familiar to your customer.
