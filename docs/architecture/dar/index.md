# Soveren Data-at-Rest (DAR) Sensor

Soveren DAR Sensor is specifically [configured](../../administration/configuring-sensor/#dar-configuration) to connect to the Customerâ€™s S3 buckets, Kafka clusters, or database instances.

Soveren DAR Sensor comprises the following parts, they are deployed once per cluster:

* _Crawler_: The core component. _Crawler_ collects samples from data sources, forwards them for detection and sends the resulting metadata to the Soveren Cloud.

* _Sensitive data detector (Detector)_: Employs proprietary machine learning algorithms to identify data types and gauge their sensitivity.

* _Kafka_: Aggregates logs of task processing by _Crawler_ or _Detector_.

We also employ Prometheus Agent for metrics collection, this component is not shown here.

The Soveren DAR Sensor follows this sequence of operations:

* _Crawler_ connects to the data source and enumerates the contents, such as S3 buckets, Kafka topics, or database tables.

* _Crawler_ then sends the enumeration results to the Soveren Cloud.

* Based on the current enumeration results and previously processed data, the Soveren Cloud forms processing tasks for the _Crawler_. An example of such a task would be analyzing a particular object (e.g. CSV file) in an S3 bucket.

* _Crawler_ processes the tasks received from the Soveren Cloud; specifically, it retrieves data samples from the sources and forwards them to the _Detector_.

* _Crawler_ then collects the detection results, forms a metadata package, and transmits it to the Soveren Cloud using the gRPC protocol and protobuf.

When available, the Crawler obtains data source metadata from the cloud provider (e.g. AWS) and sends it to the Soveren Cloud, thus enhancing data comprehensibility in the Soveren app.
